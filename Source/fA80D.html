	<h2>Annotation Commentary on the Special Teaching of the Wise and Glorious King</h2>
<p><strong><em>by Pema Kunzang Rangdrol</em></strong></p>
<p>The guru is the essence and embodiment of the three rare and supreme ones, so the text says, <strong>Homage to the master!</strong></p>
<p>There follows an explanation of the view, meditation and conduct related to the names of the root and lineage masters: <strong>The view is Longchen Rabjam: infinite, vast expanse. Meditation is Khyentse Ãzer: rays of wisdom and love. Action is GyalwÃ© Nyugu, that of the bodhisattvas. One who practises in such a way,</strong> renouncing the affairs of this life, if they are able to take this to heart, <strong>may well attain enlightenment in this very life. And even if not,</strong> since they will take up the path again in future, <strong>what happiness! What joy! A la la!</strong></p>
<h3>1. Introducing directly the face of rigpa in itself</h3>
<p><strong>As for the view, Longchen Rabjam,</strong> the instruction is <strong>the three statements</strong> that <strong>strike the vital point.</strong> As a means of introducing the view, first, <strong>relax and release your mind</strong> without contriving. Wisdom has always been present from the very beginning, so rest in a state that is <strong>neither scattered, nor concentrated, without thoughts.</strong> When you do so, as a beginner it is impossible to avoid attachment to experience, so, <strong>while resting in this even state, at ease, suddenly let out a mind-shattering âphaá¹­!â,</strong> in order to reveal naked and transparently clear awareness. To cut the chain of thoughts make the sound of 'phaá¹­' <strong>fierce, forceful and abrupt. Emaho!</strong> Immediately you will experience awareness without reference point, nakedly clear dharmakÄya, wisdom that is beyond the ordinary mind. <strong>There is nothing there: transfixed in wonder, struck by wonder, and yet all is transparent and clear.</strong> It is beyond any extreme such as arising, ceasing and so on. It is inconceivable and inexpressible wisdom: <strong>fresh, pure and sudden, so beyond description.</strong> This is the awareness that abides as the ground. <strong>Recognize this as the pure awareness of dharmakÄya</strong>, since it is the view of primordial purity beyond elaboration. This is wisdom that abides within and is not to be sought elsewhere, so the text says, <strong>'The first vital point is: introducing directly the face of rigpa in itself.'</strong></p>
<h3>2. Deciding upon one thing, and one thing only</h3>
<p>What follows is how to put this into practice through meditation. <strong>Whether</strong> mind and thoughts are <strong>in a state of movement or</strong> there are no thoughts but only <strong>stillness</strong>, in a state <strong>of anger or attachment</strong> to the five sense pleasures, <strong>happiness or sorrow,</strong> whatever happens, <strong>all the time, in any situation,</strong> you must never be apart from great spontaneous rest in the natural state. <strong>Recognize the</strong> view of the <strong>dharmakÄya you recognized before,</strong> and the clear light of the ground, which is the primordial dharmakÄya, and the path clear light pointed out by the guru â <strong>mother and child clear light â already acquainted, will reunite</strong>. <strong>Rest in the aspect of awareness, beyond all description,</strong> thought and expression. The feeling of <strong>stillness,</strong> the feeling of <strong>bliss and</strong> the feeling of <strong>clarity</strong>: whatever varied experiences might arise <strong>disrupt them, again and again.</strong> Whenever thoughts arise, let out a fierce-sounding 'Phaá¹­!' <strong>Suddenly striking with the syllable of skilful means and wisdom,</strong> repeatedly exclaim 'Phaá¹­!' and 'Phaá¹­!' Immediately disrupt attachment to experience and thinking. You must sustain the flow of inexpressible and transparently clear awareness <strong>with no difference between meditation and post-meditation.</strong> Whatever you are doing, whether sitting still or moving about, as long as you are not without the mindful awareness that sustains the essential nature, there will be <strong>no division between sessions and breaks.</strong> You must <strong>always remain in this indivisible state. But,</strong> for those of lesser capacity who might fall under the power of conceptual thought, <strong>until stability is attained, it is vital to meditate, away from all distractions and busyness, practising in proper meditation sessions and</strong> having <strong>breaks</strong> when you do not maintain the natural state. For post-meditative awareness you must let go of any focus and remain in unimpeded clarity. <strong>All the time, in any situation, abide by the flow of what is only dharmakÄya</strong> â that is, recognizing the dharmakÄya view and without any other mental activity, neither suppressing nor cultivating thoughts. <strong>Decide with absolute conviction that there is nothing other than this</strong>â genuine wisdom beyond elaboration, the union of calm and insight. <strong>The second vital point is: deciding upon one thing, and one thing only.</strong></p>
<h3>3. Confidence directly in the liberation of rising thoughts</h3>
<p>Then, without confidence in the mode of liberation you will be incapable of withstanding the conditions of attachment and aversion, so the text says: <strong>At that time, whether attachment or aversion, happiness or sorrowâall momentary thoughts, each and every one,</strong> whatever arises, whether gross or subtle, do not part from mindful awareness and do not allow thoughts to become a subtle undercurrent. <strong>Upon recognition,</strong> you must allow them to be liberated upon arising and sustain the recognition so that, just as with writing on water, they <strong>leave not a trace behind.</strong> By looking directly into your own essential nature, you will <strong>recognize the dharmakÄya in which they are freed,</strong> and thoughts will naturally disappear without trace. <strong>Just as writing vanishes on water, arising and liberation become natural and continuous. And whatever arises</strong> as thoughts based on the five poisons <strong>is</strong>, as long as we allow self-liberation to unfold, <strong>food for the bare rigpa emptiness. </strong>Whatever stirs in the mind,** as long as liberation upon arising is unobstructed, <strong>is the inner power of the dharmakÄya king.</strong> Thoughts and mental states are purified into dharmakÄya, <strong>leaving no trace, and innately pure. What joy! The way things arise may be the same as before, but,</strong> since for the yogi thoughts are liberated upon arising, <strong>the difference lies in the way they are liberated: thatâs the key.</strong> At the beginning, arising thoughts are liberated upon being recognized, like meeting an old friend; in the middle, thoughts are liberated by themselves, like a snake uncoiling its own knots;
at the end, arising thoughts are liberated without causing either benefit or harm, like a thief breaking into an empty house. This is the vital key: the way in which liberation occurs. <strong>Without this,</strong> the path that reveals self-liberation directly, <strong>meditation is but the path of delusion.</strong> <strong>When you have</strong> such a key point as this, <strong>thereâs non-meditation</strong>, meaning that there is no deliberation cultivation fabricated by the mind, and there is only <strong>the state of dharmakÄya</strong>, without deliberate application or effort. <strong>The third vital point is: confidence directly in the liberation of rising thoughts.</strong></p>
<h3>4. Colophon</h3>
<p><strong>For the view which has the three vital points</strong> mentioned above â introducing directly the face of rigpa in itself, deciding upon one thing and one thing only, and confidence directly in the liberation of rising thoughts â <strong>meditation, the union of wisdom and love,</strong> because when encountering one's own natural face of primordially pure awareness, the wisdom born of meditation and compassionate love for beings arise spontaneously. This <strong>is accompanied by the action common to all the bodhisattvas,</strong> which can be summed up as the path of the six transcendent perfections. These develop like the sun and its rays. As for this view, meditation and action, <strong>were all the buddhas of past, present and future to confer, no instruction would they find greater than this,</strong> the key point of the path of the Heart-Essence, the pinnacle of all vehicles. This profound and succinct instruction was <strong>brought out as a treasure from the depth of transcendental insight</strong>, the immaculate words of the sublime lineage gurus, <strong>by the tertÃ¶n of dharmakÄya, the inner power of rigpa.</strong> It is <strong>nothing like ordinary treasures of</strong> this world, which are but <strong>earth and stone, for</strong> this instruction of the three statements that strike the vital point <strong>is the</strong> profound <strong>final testament of Garab Dorje</strong> given to the ÄcÄrya MaÃ±juÅrÄ«mitra. It is <strong>the essence of the wisdom mind of the three transmissions:</strong> the mind-direct transmission of the victorious ones, sign transmission of the vidyÄdharas and whispered transmission of ordinary beings. <strong>It is entrusted to my heart disciples, sealed to be secret</strong> â only for students who will practise it but inappropriate to share with those who will not take the instruction to heart. <strong>It is profound in meaning, my heartâs words. It is the words of my heart, the crucial key point</strong> and distillation of the six million four hundred thousand tantras of the Great Perfection. <strong>This crucial point</strong>, since it includes all this without error: <strong>never hold it cheap,</strong> consider it trivial or treat it with ambivalence. <strong>Never let this instruction slip away from you</strong> or go to waste. Such is the advice given repeatedly.</p>
<p><strong>This is the special teaching of the wise and glorious king.</strong> In other words, this is an especially sublime instruction containing the wisdom nectar of Dza Patrul Jigme ChÃ¶kyi Wangpo.</p>
